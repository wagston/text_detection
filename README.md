# Text Detection
Real-time text detection that uses CTPN algorithm and Tensorflow framework.

Based on Tensorflow implementation of CTPN algorithm taken from here https://github.com/eragonruan/text-detection-ctpn.git.

## Setup
- Create a virtualenv and activate it.
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- Fix path to models in the code
- Connect a webcam and run 'python text_detect.py'
